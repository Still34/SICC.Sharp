# SICC.Sharp

SIC Compiler based on C#. Written for our university's System Software finals project.
Please take the results of this compiler with a grain of salt and only use it to validate your homework.

SIC/XE compilation is not yet supported and likely will never be; however, the menonic formats have already been defined within the `MnenonicList` model, so feel free to finish this project and PR if you'd like.
